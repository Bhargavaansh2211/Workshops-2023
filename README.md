## Overview  
This repository serves as the base for you to learn javascript concepts in a more better way. This repository showcases and demonstrates various modern JavaScript features and concepts.
In this tutorial, you will learn the essential concepts such as Arrow Functions, Exports, Array functions, Destructuring,  Optional Chaining,  Special Operations,  Async JS (promises).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin with this tutorial, please ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- A basic understanding of HTML. If you're new to HTML, you might want to check out introductory HTML tutorials.

- A code editor of your choice installed on your computer. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.

- Before being able to run Javascript on Visual Studio Code, you need to install Visual Studio Code and NodeJS.


## Cloning the Repository

To get started with the tutorial, follow these steps to clone the repository to your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Open your terminal or command prompt and use the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git https://github.com/username/Workshops-2023.git
   ```

   Replace `username` with your GitHub username.

2. **Navigate to the Repository Folder**: Use the `cd` (change directory) command to navigate to the cloned repository folder:

   ```bash
   cd Workshops-2023
   ```

## Running the HTML, CSS and Javascript files locally

After cloning the repository, you can run the HTML and CSS files locally to see the tutorial examples in action. Here's how:

1. **Open the HTML File**: Locate the HTML file (usually named `index.html`) in the cloned repository folder. Open it in your code editor.

2. **Open the CSS File (if present)**: If there is a separate CSS file (usually named `style.css`), open it in your code editor. You may also find inline CSS within the HTML file.

3. **View in Browser**: To view the web page, right-click on the `index.html` file in your code editor and select "Open with Live Server" if your code editor supports this feature. If not, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser by double-clicking it.

4. **Preview the Web Page**: You should see the web pages rendered in your browser. You can make changes to the HTML and CSS files and see the results instantly by refreshing the web page.
5. **Compiling and Running Javascript files**: To compile and run your javascript code run the command `Node <filename>.js` in your terminal or command prompt.
   ```bash
   Node <filename>.js
   ```
## Tutorial Content
Inside this repository, you will find:

- **Arrow Functions:** Use of concise arrow function syntax for improved readability and shorter code snippets.

- **Exports:** Module exports to make code modular and reusable, facilitating better code organization.

- **Array Functions:** Leveraging array functions such as `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` for efficient manipulation and processing of arrays.

- **Destructuring:** Utilizing destructuring syntax to extract values from objects and arrays in a concise manner.

- **Optional Chaining:** Employing optional chaining to handle nested properties and method calls more gracefully.

- **Special Operations:** Implementation of special operations such as `ternary operator` and `nullish coalescing operator`.

- **Async JS (Promises):** Integrating asynchronous JavaScript using Promises for handling asynchronous operations.

Feel free to explore the provided content, follow the tutorial instructions, and experiment with code to enhance your understanding.
